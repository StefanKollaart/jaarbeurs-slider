# Jaarbeurs Utrecht Slider

This is a responsive slider, build in HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS. I build this as a programming assesment for Jaarbeurs Utrecht. You can download the project and open index.html to view it. You can also view this project on Github Pages: https://stefankollaart.github.io/jaarbeurs-slider/
